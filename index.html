        <div class="subheading mb-5">Undeclared College of Humanities Arts and Social SciencesðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Kayla Adriano! I am currently a second year undeclared major in the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences with an interest in psychology.  Below are some, but not all, key experiences which help best describe me!<br><br>

        I have an interest in health sciences and during my last year of high school decided to volunteer at my local hospital.  This opportunity allowed me to experience first hand how a pediatric floor operates.  I was able to meet some great people, develop those skills interacting with patients and their parents, and assisted in maintaining the floor.  My main responsibilities were to insure the cleanliness and organization of the playroom, assist with any needs of patients, parents, and visitors, assist in discharging patients, and ensure a comfortable stay for the patients and their families.  
<br><br>
        During my senior year of high school I was selected to be one of around thirty students to participate in a new honors psychology course.  In this course, with a partner, we chose a topic of interest to research in relation to our school.  My research partner and I decided to research the mental health of students who identified as a minority and their experience at a predominantly white high school.  Over the course of nine months we conducted surveys, interviewed students, analyzed data, and finally presented our findings to our community in a research showcase hosted by our school.  The overall experience allowed me to expand my research skills and expose myself to various techniques of research.  
<br><br>
        In March of 2019 I started working at my local ice cream shop.  As it was my first real work experience besides babysitting and small paid experiences, I was able to greatly grow my skills in responsibility and customer service.  I learned how to work with people, deal with money, hold conversations with customers, and assist customers, and the company to the best of my abilities.  Customer service is something I enjoy as I like helping people when I can.  
<br><br>
        In high school as a freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior you get the opportunity to go on a retreat.  The senior year retreat, called Kairos, is led by fellow seniors who are appointed by the faculty and staff of the school.  I was one of twelve chosen to lead this special retreat for my fellow classmates.  Leading this special retreat for my class was an unforgettable experience as I was able to develop my leadership skills.  As a leader you give a testimony to your classmates, lead them throughout their spiritual journey and grow together as a class.  It is a very emotional and vulnerable retreat which I am grateful I had the experience of leading.  
<br><br>
        Overall I have various skills and strengths to offer.  In experience volunteering, working with, and leading others, I am a fast learner, I can communicate effectively, and I can take initiative when needed.  Given my experience with research, I have developed my research skills including data analysis and presentation skills.
